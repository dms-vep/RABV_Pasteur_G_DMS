# Scratch notebooks
### Arjun Aditham, Bloom Lab (2024)

This directory contains notebooks that run scripts for custom analyses. They do not run as part of the pipeline. Some rely on data that is produced by the pipeline. Others were scripted in order to produce pre-requisite information for the pipeline.
