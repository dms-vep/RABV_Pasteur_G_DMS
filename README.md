# Deep mutational scanning of the Rabies glycoprotein (G) Pasteur Strain 
Study by Arjun Aditham and Jesse Bloom.



This repo contains data and analyses from deep mutational scanning experiments on the Rabies glycoprotein (G). All experiments were performed on the Pasteur strain of rabies [NC_001542.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_001542.1). 


The deep mutational scan only consists of the ectodomain of Rabies G and few sites flanking the ectodomain (positions 18-450). Site 403 is poorly represented. Stop codons were incorporated at alternating positions for sites 18-56 (~20 stop codons).
